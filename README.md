## n-grams implementation

I learned about how n-grams works through watching multiple Youtube Videos as I am trying to learn more about language models and how they work so I can create my own!

My implementation was written in ~45 minutes with the goal of just getting it to work with no other design decisions in mind. 

üçù Spaghetti code to say the least!

During the actual co-working session which consists of 2 1 hour work sessions I learned to utilize Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
